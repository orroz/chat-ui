Add your general design and decision comments here:

Challenge was solved using react and redux.
All source code is under ./src directory.
Framework used for tests is jest and all tests are under ./__test__ directory.
socket.io calls were combine as a middleware of the store before dispatching of actions to reducer.
userName and avatar index were saved on local storage for persistency .

To run:
1. Fetch repository from git.
2. Run npm i
3. Run npm start
4. Open at least 2 windows with localhost:3000
5. Add a user name for each of the windows (They must be unique).
6. Write your message down and press enter (or click send).

*. to change avatar on the window - open console log. type: localStorage.avatarIndex = {any number between 0 to 4}. and refresh.

To run tests:

1. npm test
2. Tests included - unit testing for all actions on reducer + snapshot testing for all components.
